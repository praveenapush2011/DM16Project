
Project Title: Customer Lead Prediction
Technologies: Data Cleansing, EDA, Visualization, Regression(Optional), Tableau/Power-BI
Domain: Ed-Tech


Problem Statement:
The online Edu-Tech platform that generates leads through various sources. The marketing and sales teams want to optimize their lead conversion rates and improve the efficiency of their lead management process. The primary goal is to predict whether a lead will be successfully converted into a customer or not. This prediction can help the Edu-Tech company to prioritize leads with the highest conversion potential and tailor marketing and sales strategies accordingly. The analysis and prediction (optional) will be based on the information available in the provided dataset.

About Data:

Context

This dataset contains one file for a lead generation and conversion campaign for an Edu-tech company. The data includes information about the leads, their activity, and their preferences

 
Problem to be answered:

This customer data holds immense potential for improving customer acquisition, optimizing marketing efforts, and enhancing lead conversion rates. By thoroughly analyzing this data, we can extract valuable insights into customer behaviors, preferences, and conversion patterns. These insights serve as the foundation for developing targeted marketing campaigns, refining lead nurturing strategies, and identifying areas for improvement across the sales and marketing process.

Predictive modeling is not always essential. In many cases, the insights gained from exploratory data analysis alone can be sufficient to drive positive outcomes. However, if prediction is necessary, the insights gained from analysis provide a solid foundation for developing more accurate and reliable predictive models.

Data analysis and understanding, Edu-Tech Company can gain a significant competitive edge and achieve its strategic objectives. This data-driven approach will empower the company to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately, cultivate a thriving customer base.
